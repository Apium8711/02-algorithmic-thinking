# Python and Turtles

### Excitement and Exercises!
There is a 'skeleton' for each of these, in the assignment that you've checked out.  The answers are also all there.  It's up to you to calculate those answers.  Fill your code into the existing files, as indicated.

1. Find the 9th positive integer that is a multiple of 4, 13, 14, 26, and 50.
2. Fibonacci numbers are defined by adding the previous two terms.  Starting with 1 and 1, that gives 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.  Find the sum of all Fibonnacci numbers divisible by 17 and below 1 billion.  (`while` and `if`, and `%`)
3. The number 175832868806 has no prime factors above 300.  Count the unique prime factors.  (Hint: first make a list of all the primes up to 300.)
4. There is a 1000-digit number, below.  If you multiply five consecutive digits, the largest value you can find is 95999:.  Multiplying 12 consecutive digits, what is the largest product you can find?
5. Pythagorean triples have the property _a² + b² = c²_.  For instance the familiar 3, 4, 5 triangle has _3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5²_.  There is one pythagorean triple for which _a + b + c = 1000_.  Find the product _a × b × c_.
6. Within _hw1_support.py_, you will find a list of 80 50-digit numbers.  Find their sum.
7. Find the sum of the base-10 digits in _2⁸⁶⁵_.

Just make sure it's in before Wednesday October 12th at 1:30am!
